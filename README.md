  <h2>About spce.moe</h2>

  spce.moe is a domain for (my) personal use & projects.<br>
  The intent of this website is simply to be a landing page<br>
  whilst also serving some of my interests and hobbies.<br>
  It's been a huge journey and lots of fun working with<br>
  web design and frameworks. As well as hosting these to<br>
  the public. (๑′ᴗ‵๑)<br>

  No dependencies are needed. You can just host/open these files<br>
  to display them in the browser.<br>

  For projects post-2022:<br>
  This project depends on the following:
  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)<br>
